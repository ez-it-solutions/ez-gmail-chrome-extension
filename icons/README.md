## Creating Icons

To create proper icons for this extension:

1. Design a square icon (recommended: 512x512 or 1024x1024)
2. Use the "eye" theme to represent incognito/privacy
3. Use the brand colors: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
4. Export in PNG format at the required sizes
5. Ensure transparency is maintained

## Temporary Placeholder

Currently, placeholder icon files need to be created. You can:
- Use an online icon generator
- Create them in Photoshop/GIMP/Figma
- Use a simple eye icon with the brand gradient

## Design Guidelines

- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use high contrast for visibility
- Match the purple gradient theme from the UI
- Consider the icon will be displayed on various backgrounds
